    <p> The greatest truths are often found at exhaustion, in the beyond.</p>

<!-- FAQ SECTION -->
<div id="faq" class="section">
    <h2>[Frequently?] Asked Questions</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: How is this different from Big Sunday Runs (BSR)?</strong><br>
        A: We are a <i>slightly</i> organised group of runners that take care of the boring stuff, so the fun stuff can happen! We also support and collaborate with other good people, doing good stuff.<br>
        BSR runners might be members of W.R.E.C’kd, but not all W.R.E.C’kd members would identify BSR.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: I know trail running?:</strong><br>
        A: Adventure running, endurance racing. Running for hours in the wilderness.
    </p>

    <p>
        We exist for the people who are up for the challenge in the remote and unknown. We are a community that pushes the boundary of possibility. We are people who think being in beautiful places is the most rewarding when the mahi is shared.
    </p>

    <p>
        Adventure can be a time for competition, for the hard-core, people hoping to complete routes as quickly as possible, as they would in a race. Then, the informal rivalries, maybe a match between old mates before a cold one at the pub.
    </p>

    <p>
        We keep track of elapsed time and think Fastest-Known-Times (FKTs) are cool! We have good-natured informal competition between the other running establishments of Wellington and beyond. The first one home might have the warmest sausage, a pat on the back, and all the tales from the day's activities...but not much else.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: Why an Inc.?</strong><br>
        A: Admin! The best way to host grassroots running events for the community is as a collective. We create epic adventures and aren't interested in commercial gain. We have created a society to formalise the community of like-minded people. These people are not interested in the typical consumer event of today with the branding, prizes, merch, running stones, and affiliate marketing.
    </p>

    <p>
        For transparency, we couldn't care for the bureaucracy or expensive paperwork. We are about breaking down barriers. Things don't need to be difficult and time-consuming. We just wish to be outside.
    </p>

    <p>
        W.R.E.C’kd only allows its members to participate in our events, and as such, our activities are simply recreation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: Safety, though?</strong><br>
        A: While we may not be about box-ticking, each event is given thought, and a plan will be included in the trip or event synopsis.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our participants are expected to be self-reliant. You may need a higher level of navigation proficiency or mountain wisdom before partaking in a W.R.E.C’kd event.
    </p>

    <p>
        We may require live-tracking for certain expeditions [a dot to watch], and first-time participants may be requested to travel as a team, with experienced members.
    </p>

    <p>
        W.R.E.C’kd understands the inherent risks of wilderness running. Our members will be prepared, observant, and make safe decisions. We understand that sometimes interventions are necessitated, and these are expensive and burdensome; we will support the efforts of LandSAR through our
        <span class="link-text" onclick="showSection('rescue-fund')">Rescue Fund</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: Waivers and Compulsory Gear?</strong><br>
        A: All W.R.E.C’KD trips and races are managed by volunteer members, meaning that ultimately all trip participants are responsible for their own safety and that of others. As a member, you should be familiar with the finer details of an event and abide by our Code of Conduct.
    </p>

    <p>
        You should understand the
        <a href="https://www.mountainsafety.org.nz/learn/resources/land-safety-code" target="_blank">
            NZ Land Safety Code</a> and the critical life-saving principles.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will provide route maps and a preliminary trip synopsis. Prospective Members of W.R.E.C’kd are asked if they have
        <span class="link-text" onclick="showSection('Gear')">essential safety gear</span>
        you may depend on. Every run has its own challenges and uniqueness. The event leader reserves the right to check and question a participating member's gear or capabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: How are the subs set?</strong><br>
        A: We set an annual subscription so our members can access benefits, including our events and offerings. Outside of the advertised activities, we provide advocacy and support for endeavors that align with our philosophy.
    </p>

    <p>
        If our events take place on conservation land, then we can only charge for the recovery costs. The society still has other substantial costs such as insurance, planning time, admin. and communications. Subs are set by the committee and voted on at the AGM.
    </p>

    <p>
        Membership includes a contribution to the Rescue fund and membership with the Federated Mountain Clubs. Our members are eligible for some pretty sweet discounts.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: How is this accessible?</strong><br>
        A: Our founding mission is built on the philosophy of Big Sunday Runs; we’d rather just be out there doing it!
    </p>

    <p>
        We think this model can break down barriers, so we can all run in epic places.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to join us, but maybe things are a little bit tight, we'll sort you out.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: Love it! How can I help?</strong><br>
        A: W.R.E.C’kd is not built on a charitable mission. But, we’d love it if you could participate in our events and activities!
    </p>

    <p>
        Volunteer, or maybe reach out if you want to talk about sponsorships/partnerships.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: I’m a financial member, but can’t make an event.</strong><br>
        A: Cool, your support can still cover membership fees for those who can't afford it, or you may donate to cool projects, and our friends at GWBN, Wellington LandSAR, and local environment groups.
    </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Q: How do I become a member?</strong><br>
        A: Give a quick look at our trip page to see if you are up for the missions! Then head over to the <span class="link-text" onclick="showSection('membership')">membership page</span>

    <div id="rescue-fund" class="section">
        <h2>The Rescue Fund</h2>
        <div class="byline">[Safety in the Collective]</div>
        <p>In the hills, shit happens. Sometimes things do not go to plan or forecast.</p>
           <p>The Rescue Fund is a pool of capital set aside to assist financial members or to help support the cost of misadventure.</p>
              <p>  Rescue is free in Aotearoa thanks to our emergency services and LANDSAR, but we recognise that our pursuit is high-risk, there is an aftermath, and extraction can be pricey.</p>


        <h3>Principles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-sufficiency:</strong> This fund is not an insurance policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Discretionary:</strong> Funds are for major incidents that have been reviewed. </li>
            <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Access to the fund is governed by the committee's commonsense.
</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box">
            The Fine Print<p>
            Preparedness is a prerequisite. The fund is prioritised for major incidents if they occur during sanctioned W.R.E.C’kd activities.<p>
          The balance of the Rescue Fund will be reported in the Financial Statements. If the pot gets "too big", surplus will be donated to partners at LandSAR<p>
         It will not be used to cover negligence, fines, losses or “bad press”.

        <p><strong>[Synopsis]</strong><br>
        <p>Starting at the mouth of the Orongorongo River. The first ~12km heads east along the Wild Coast Trail. Remote and rugged.</p>
        <p>Not long past Mukamukaiti Stream and some sandy trail, head North, leaving the sea behind to enter the Mukamuka valley; watch the cows here.</p>
        <p>Keep your wits as you take the main valley (avoiding various tributaries). This is a rugged, rocky "plough" up to South Saddle.</p>
        <p>From South Saddle, you drop onto the Mt Matthews Track. It is steep, technical, and built for those who like a high "gnarl-meter" reading. Follow this northward to the Matthews Stream, and continue down to the Orongorongo River.</p>
        <p>The Finish: Slightly downriver; cross and  immediately pick up the Big Bend Track on the far side at the Whakanui Stream confluence.</p>
        <p>After ~3km on Big Bend, and just after the “Oriental Bridge”, hit the Orongorongo Track and head west. It’s an honest climb away from the river and a fast descent through the Catchpool Stream to the finish line at the Visitor Centre.</p>

        <p><strong>[Synopsis]</strong><br>
        <p>Starting at the Mangatoetoe, the course follows the classic multiday Aorangi route.</p>
        <p>Following the Mangatoeotoe river to Mangatoetoe hut,  the trail meanders in and out've streams, before the first undulation.</p>
        <p>A short climb levels out before dropping steeply down a loose rocky path to the next stream. Freely navigate the stream here to the flats of Kawakawa Hut.</p>
        <p>The next undulation, more significant than the last, begins with pinch climb to knife-edge ridge, that continues up, up, up! Care is required along the scrambly sidle amongst the infamous Ongaonga.</p>
        <p>Drop down to Pararaki Hut, topping up water before continuing up, for what is the most substantial and continuous undulation. The hint of views exist just before the top, before plunging, without any control down to Washpool Hut.</p>
        <p>The final undulation is a lot like the last; it levels off at the top, before a series of false peaks as you head to the Pinnacles track to a warm sausage at the Putangirua Pinnacles campsite.</p>
