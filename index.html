    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>[for the rugged, the tired, and the adventurous]</p>
    <p>the greatest truths are often found at exhaustion, in the beyond.</p>

<div id="faq" class="section">
    <h2>[Frequently?] Asked Questions</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: How is this different from Big Sunday Runs (BSR)?</strong><br>
        A: We are a slightly organised group of runners that takes care of the boring stuff, so the fun stuff can happen! We also support and collaborate with other good people, doing good stuff.<br>
        BSR runners might be members of W.R.E.C’kd, but not all W.R.E.C’kd members would identify BSR.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: I know trail running?:</strong><br>
        A: Adventure running, endurance racing. Running for hours, in the wilderness.
    </p>

    <p>
        We exist for the people that are for up for the challenge in the remote and unknown. We are a community thats pushes the boundary of possibility. We are people that think being in beautiful places is the most rewarding when the mahi is shared.
    </p>

    <p>
        Adventure can be a time for competition, for the hard-core, people hoping to complete routes as quickly as possible, like they would as a race. Then, the informal rivalries; maybe a match between mates before a cold one at the pub.
    </p>

    <p>
        We keep track of elapsed time and think Fastest-Known-Times (FKTs) are cool! We have good natured informal competition between the other running establishments of Wellington and beyond. The first one home might have the warmest sausage, a pat on the back and all the tales from the days activities, but not much else.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: Why an Inc.?</strong><br>
        A: Admin! The best way to host grassroots running events for the community, is as a collective. We create epic adventures and aren't interested in commercial gain. We have created a society to formalise the community of like-minded people. These people are not interested in the typical consumer event of today with the branding, prizes, merch., running stones and affliate marketing.
    </p>

    <p>
        For transparency; we couldn't care for the bureaucracy or expensive paperwork. We are for breaking the barriers of difficulty, logistical limit, and time costs. We just wish to be outside.
    </p>

    <p>
        W.R.E.C’kd only allows its members to participate in our events, and as such our activities are simply recreation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: Safety, though?</strong><br>
        A: While we may not be box ticking, each event is given thought, and a plan will be included in the trip or event synopsis.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our participants are expected to be self-reliant. You may need a higher level of navigation proficiency or mountain wisdom before partaking in a W.R.E.C’kd event.
    </p>

    <p>
        We may require live-tracking for certain expeditions [a dot to watch], and first-time participants maybe requested they travel as a team, and with experienced member/s.
    </p>

    <p>
        W.R.E.C’kd understands the inherent risks of wilderness running. Our members will be prepared, observant and make safe decisions. We understand interventions that are sometimes necessitated are expensive and burdensome, we support the efforts of LandSAR through our
        <span class="link-text" onclick="showSection('rescue-fund')">Rescue Fund</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: Waivers and Compulsory Gear?</strong><br>
        A: All W.R.E.C’KD trips are led by volunteer members meaning that ultimately all trip participants are responsible for their own safety and that of others. As a member you should be familiar with the finer details of an event, and abide by our Code of Conduct.
    </p>

    <p>
        You should understand the
        <a href="https://www.mountainsafety.org.nz/learn/resources/land-safety-code" target="_blank">
            NZ Land Safety Code
        </a>
        and the critical live saving principles.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will provide route maps and a preliminary trip synopsis. Prospective Members of W.R.E.C’kd are asked if they have
        <span class="link-text" onclick="showSection('Gear')">essential safety gear</span>
        you may depend on. Every run has its own challenges, and uniqueness. The event leader reserves the right to check and question a participating members gear.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: How are the subs set?</strong><br>
        A: We set an annual subscription so our members can access benefits including our events and offerings. Outside of the advertised activities we provide advocacy and support for endeavour that align with our philosophy.
    </p>

    <p>
        If our events take place on conservation land, then we can only charge for the recovery costs, and the society still has other substantial costs such as insurance, planning time, admin. and communications. Subs are set by the committee and voted on at the AGM.
    </p>

    <p>
        Membership includes a contribution to the Rescue fund and membership with the Federated Mountain Clubs. Our members are eligible for some pretty sweet discounts.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: How is this accessible?</strong><br>
        A: Our founding mission is built on the philosophy of Big Sunday Runs, we’d rather just be out there doing it!
    </p>

    <p>
        We think this model can break down barriers, so we can all run in epic places.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to join us, but maybe things are little bit tight, we'll sort you out.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: Love it! How can I help?</strong><br>
        A: W.R.E.C’kd is not built on a charitable mission. But, we’d love it if you could participate in our events and activities!
    </p>

    <p>
        Volunteer or maybe reach out if you want to talk sponsorships/partnerships.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q: I’m a financial member, but can’t make an event.</strong><br>
        A: Cool, we’ll use your monies to cover membership fees for those who can't afford it or donate to cool projects, and our friends at GWBN, Wellington LandSAR, and local environment groups…
    </p>

    <p>
        We are dreaming of getting the Kaweka Challenge back up and running!

    <div id="rescue-fund" class="section">
        <h2>The Rescue Fund</h2>
        <div class="byline">[Safety in the Collective]</div>
        <p>In the hills, shit happens. Sometimes things don't go to plan or forecast.</p>
           <p>The Rescue Fund is a pool of capital set aside to assist financial members or to help support the cost of misadventure.</p>
              <p>  Rescue is free in Aotearoa thanks to RCCNZ and LANDSAR, but we recognise that our pursuit is high-risk and the aftermath of an extraction is pricey.</p>


        <h3>Principles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-sufficiency:</strong> This fund is not an insurance policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Discretionary:</strong> Typically funds would be used for major incidents that have been reviewed. </li>
            <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Access to the fund is governed by the common sense of the Committee.
</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box">
            The Fine Print<p>
            Preparedness is Prerequisite. The fund is prioritised for major incidents (if) they occur during sanctioned W.R.E.C’kd activities.<p>
          The balance of the Rescue Fund will be reported in Financial Statements. If the pot gets "too big", the surplus will be donated to partners Wellington LandSAR, or Wellington AREC.<p>
         it does not cover Negligence, fines, or losses or “bad press”.

        <p><strong>[Synopsis]</strong><br>
        Starting at the mouth of the Orongorongo River. The first ~12km heads East along Wild Coast Trail. Remote and rugged.<br>
        Not long, past Mukamukaiti Stream and some sandy trail, head North, leaving the sea behind to enter the Mukamuka Stream valley. Watch the cows here, and keep your wits about you here—take the main valley (various tributary). This is a rugged, rocky "plow" up to South Saddle.<br>
        From the Saddle, you drop onto the Mt Matthews Track. It is steep, technical, and built for those who like a high "gnarl-meter" reading. Follow this Northward to the Matthews Stream, and continue down to the Orongorongo River.<br>
        The Finish: Cross the river and immediately pick up the Big Bend Track on the far side at the Whakanui Stream confluence.<br>
        After ~3km on Big Bend, and the “Oriental Bridge” hit the Orongorongo Track and head West. It’s an honest climb away from the river and a fast descent through the Catchpool Stream to the finish line at the Visitor Centre.

            <strong>FAQs</strong>
            <p><strong>"I’m not a member, can I join?"</strong> This is a planned W.R.E.C’kd event for our financial members. We want to host grassroots running events (and participate in them). We have formed a community of like-minded people, so join us.</p>
            <p><strong>Can I go home?</strong> It is point to point, if you want to return the way you came? Its long walk/run out regardless.</p>
            <p><strong>Are there cut-offs?</strong> No, but please start together. However, if you think cut-offs could be a concern, maybe choose another one of our events.</p>
